# SiSC
Simple Storage Cluster is a open-source storage cluster build for easy replication and encryption. This software project is in design stage, that means that you cannot download an "pre-alpha" since it is not even basically implemented. If you want to aid the design stage, look at the [design document](https://github.com/Sebb767/SiSC/blob/master/README.md) and commit or open issues.
